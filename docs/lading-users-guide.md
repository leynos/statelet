# Lading user guide

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

`lading` is a command-line tool for managing release workflows in Rust
workspaces. It can:

- Bump versions across the workspace (`Cargo.toml` files) and keep internal
  dependency requirements in sync.
- Update version references inside TOML code fences in Markdown documentation.
- Plan and execute publication (`cargo package` + `cargo publish`) in dependency
  order, with pre-flight `cargo check`/`cargo test` validation.

> **Breaking change in 0.1.0 — `--live` interleaving**
>
> Prior to 0.1.0, `lading publish --live` ran a two-phase pipeline: all
> crates were packaged before any were published. From 0.1.0 onwards the
> live pipeline is interleaved — each crate is packaged and published in
> turn before the next crate is processed. Dry-run mode retains the
> original two-phase order. Workspaces that relied on the old sequencing
> must adopt the new per-crate ordering; no configuration knob restores
> the prior behaviour.

The 0.1.0 release also changes workspace README adoption:

> **Breaking change in 0.1.0 — workspace README adoption**
>
> Prior to 0.1.0, `lading publish` copied the workspace `README.md` into
> crates that set `readme.workspace = true` while preparing the staged
> workspace. From 0.1.0 onwards, `lading bump` performs that adoption and
> rewrites relative Markdown links before publishing. Commit the adopted
> crate README files produced by `lading bump` before running `lading publish`;
> publish staging no longer creates or repairs those files.

## Installation

### Install from a wheel (recommended for internal distribution)

Build a wheel from the repository, then install it:

```bash
make build-release
python -m pip install dist/*.whl
```

### Install for development (using uv)

Create a development environment and run `lading` via `uv`:

```bash
make build
uv run lading --help
```

## Tutorial

This tutorial assumes a Rust workspace with a root `Cargo.toml` and one or more
member crates.

### 1. Create `lading.toml`

Create a minimal configuration file at the workspace root:

```toml
[bump.documentation]
globs = ["README.md", "docs/**/*.md"]

[publish]
strip_patches = "per-crate"
```

`lading.toml` can be omitted entirely. When absent, `lading` uses the defaults
documented in the configuration reference below.

### 2. Bump versions

To update the workspace and member crate manifests to `1.2.3`:

```bash
lading bump 1.2.3
```

To preview changes without writing any files:

```bash
lading bump 1.2.3 --dry-run
```

After updating manifest versions, `lading bump` automatically refreshes any
git-tracked `Cargo.lock` files (excluding those under `target/`) that have an
adjacent `Cargo.toml`. Refreshed lockfiles are listed in the command output
with a `(lockfile)` suffix. In dry-run mode the lockfiles are listed but not
modified.

If `bump.documentation.globs` is configured, `lading` also searches those
Markdown files for TOML code fences and updates version values that refer to
workspace crates.

### 3. Publish in dry-run mode

By default, `publish` runs `cargo publish --dry-run` so the full pipeline can
be validated without uploading crates.

```bash
lading publish
```

Before running `cargo check` and `cargo test`, `lading publish` validates that
all git-tracked `Cargo.lock` files are fresh under `--locked` mode. If any
lockfile is stale — for example after a `lading bump` that regenerated a nested
workspace lockfile — the command exits with code 1 and prints a repair command:

```text
Tracked Cargo.lock files are stale after manifest version changes.
Run the following to repair:
  cargo generate-lockfile --manifest-path <path>/Cargo.toml
```

Run the repair command, commit the updated lockfile, then re-run
`lading publish`.

To require a clean working tree before running the pre-flight checks, pass
`--forbid-dirty`:

```bash
lading publish --forbid-dirty
```

To perform a real publish (no `--dry-run`), pass `--live`:

```bash
lading publish --live
```

Dry-run publishing packages every publishable crate first, then runs
`cargo publish --dry-run` for every crate. Live publishing follows
`publish.order` crate by crate: `cargo package`, then `cargo publish`, then the
next crate. This lets a later crate depend on a newly published earlier crate
in the same `--live` run. Live publishing is not transactional; if a later
crate fails, crates already uploaded to crates.io are not rolled back. Reruns
skip versions that are already present on crates.io and continue with the
remaining crates.

`bump` adopts the workspace `README.md` for any member crate that sets
`readme.workspace = true`. The adopted README is written into the crate
directory and relative Markdown links are rewritten so they still resolve from
that directory. `publish` then stages the already-prepared workspace into a
temporary directory before packaging.

#### Dry-run limitations with unpublished workspace dependencies

`cargo package` validates dependency versions against the live crates.io index,
even in dry-run mode. When two or more workspace crates are released together
for the first time and one depends on another at a version that is not yet on
crates.io, `cargo package` will fail with an error similar to:

```text
error: failed to prepare local package for uploading

Caused by:
  failed to select a version for the requirement `inner_crate = "^0.8.0"`
  candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.7.0, 0.6.0, ...
  location searched: crates.io index
  required by package `outer_crate v0.8.0`
```

This affects dry-run release trains that introduce a new shared version across
multiple workspace crates. `lading publish --live` avoids the limitation by
publishing each crate immediately after it is packaged, so a later crate can
resolve a dependency that an earlier crate in `publish.order` just uploaded.
Plain dry-runs still use Cargo's live index. By default, `lading` downgrades
these index-lookup failures to warnings when the missing dependency is also in
the publish plan and appears earlier in publish order.

##### Manual staged publishing

When a release must be split manually, run `lading publish --live` for the
foundational crate first, then run `lading publish` (dry-run) or
`lading publish --live` for the remaining workspace once the new version is
indexed:

```bash

# 1. Publish the foundational crate live so crates.io has the new version.
lading publish --live --workspace-root path/to/workspace

# 2. Once the new version is indexed, publish (or dry-run) dependent crates.
lading publish --workspace-root path/to/workspace
```

`lading` skips crates whose versions are already on crates.io, so the second
invocation only acts on the remaining crates.

##### `--allow-unpublished-workspace-deps` (dry-run only)

For CI gating where a real publish is not desirable, dry-run mode defaults to
the same behaviour as passing `--allow-unpublished-workspace-deps`: it
downgrades the index-lookup failure to a warning when the missing dependency is
itself part of the planned publish set and appears earlier in publish order:

```bash
lading publish --allow-unpublished-workspace-deps
```

The override applies to both the `cargo package` step and the subsequent
`cargo publish --dry-run` step (which packages internally and hits the same
crates.io index lookup), so the dry run completes end-to-end.

Use `--no-allow-unpublished-workspace-deps` to opt out during dry-runs and keep
Cargo's index lookup strict:

```bash
lading publish --no-allow-unpublished-workspace-deps
```

`--allow-unpublished-workspace-deps` is rejected when combined with `--live`
because the failure cannot be bypassed during a real publish.
`--no-allow-unpublished-workspace-deps` remains valid with `--live`; it
preserves the strict behaviour that live publishes already use. When the
missing dependency is **not** in the publish plan, or when it appears **after**
the current crate in `publish.order`, the failure is still treated as an error.
Fix the explicit `publish.order` so foundational crates come before dependants,
or remove `publish.order` and rely on dependency-derived topological sorting.

## Configuration reference (`lading.toml`)

`lading` looks for `lading.toml` in the workspace root. The file must be a TOML
table at the top level. Unknown keys are rejected with a configuration error.

All paths and globs are interpreted relative to the workspace root.

### Complete example

```toml
[bump]
exclude = ["some-private-crate"]
lockfile_manifests = ["crates/nested/Cargo.toml"]
rebuild_lockfiles = true

[bump.documentation]
globs = ["README.md", "docs/**/*.md"]

[publish]
exclude = ["some-internal-tooling-crate"]
order = ["core", "utils", "app"]
strip_patches = "per-crate" # "all" | "per-crate" | false

[preflight]
test_exclude = ["slow-integration-suite"]
unit_tests_only = false
aux_build = [["cargo", "+nightly", "test", "-p", "lint", "--no-run"]]
compiletest_extern = {
  ui_test_helpers = "target/debug/deps/libui_test_helpers.so"
}
env = { DYLINT_LOCALE = "en_GB" }
stderr_tail_lines = 40
```

### `[bump]`

- `exclude`: array of strings, default `[]`. Crate names to exclude from
  manifest updates.
- `lockfile_manifests`: array of strings, default `[]`. Additional
  `Cargo.toml` manifests whose adjacent `Cargo.lock` files should be
  regenerated after `lading bump`. The workspace root `Cargo.toml` is always
  included and should not be listed.
- `rebuild_lockfiles`: boolean, default `true`. Controls whether `lading bump`
  regenerates the workspace lockfile and configured nested lockfiles after
  manifest updates. Pass `--no-rebuild-lockfiles` to skip regeneration for a
  single run, or `--rebuild-lockfiles` to force regeneration when
  `rebuild_lockfiles` is configured as `false`.

Lockfile regeneration runs
`cargo update --workspace --manifest-path <manifest>` for the workspace root
and each configured nested manifest. This updates workspace package entries
while avoiding a full transitive dependency refresh. If Cargo fails, manifest
changes have already been written. Fix the underlying Cargo error and rerun
`lading bump`, use `--no-rebuild-lockfiles` and regenerate lockfiles manually,
or run the relevant Cargo command yourself before committing the bump.

### `[bump.documentation]`

- `globs`: array of strings, default `[]`. Glob patterns for Markdown files
  whose TOML code fences should be updated.

### `[publish]`

- `exclude`: array of strings, default `[]`. Crate names to exclude from
  publication.
- `order`: array of strings, default `[]`. Explicit publish order; overrides
  dependency-derived ordering when present.
- `strip_patches`: one of `"all"`, `"per-crate"`, or `false`; default
  `"per-crate"`. Controls how `[patch.crates-io]` is edited in the staged
  workspace before packaging.

### `[preflight]`

- `test_exclude`: array of strings, default `[]`. Crate names to exclude from
  `cargo test` by passing `--exclude`.
- `unit_tests_only`: boolean, default `false`. Append `--lib --bins` to the
  pre-flight `cargo test` invocation.
- `aux_build`: nested array of strings, default `[]`. Extra tokenized commands
  to run before cargo pre-flight checks.
- `compiletest_extern`: table of string keys and values, default `{}`. Extra
  `--extern` entries to append to `RUSTFLAGS` for compiletest-style suites.
- `env`: table of string keys and values, default `{}`. Environment overrides
  applied to git/cargo invocations run by `publish`.
- `stderr_tail_lines`: integer greater than or equal to zero, default `40`.
  Number of lines to tail from referenced `*.stderr` files when tests fail.

## Reference: CLI flags and environment variables

### `--workspace-root`

`--workspace-root` specifies the workspace root explicitly. The flag can appear
before or after the subcommand:

```bash
lading --workspace-root /path/to/workspace bump 1.2.3
lading bump 1.2.3 --workspace-root /path/to/workspace
```

When present, the resolved path is also exported as `LADING_WORKSPACE_ROOT` for
the duration of the command.

### `LADING_LOG_LEVEL`

Set `LADING_LOG_LEVEL` to control verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`,
`ERROR`, `CRITICAL`). The default is `INFO`.
