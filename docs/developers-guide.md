# Developer Guide

This guide explains the contributor workflow and implementation tooling for the
generated Statelet project.

## Generated project shape

Statelet uses Rust 2024, a pinned nightly toolchain, strict lint settings, and
documented starter code. The current repository is a library project and renders
`src/lib.rs`.

## Local Workflow

Use `make all` as the public entrypoint for formatting, linting, and tests.
`make lint` runs rustdoc, Clippy, and Whitaker. `make test` prefers
`cargo nextest run` and falls back to `cargo test` when cargo-nextest is not
available. `make audit` derives the Rust workspace root with `cargo metadata`,
logs workspace member manifests, and runs `cargo audit` once from the workspace
root. `make coverage` uses `cargo llvm-cov` with `lld`.

The generated `Makefile` exposes these public targets:

- `make all` runs formatting checks, linting, and tests.
- `make check-fmt` verifies Rust formatting.
- `make lint` runs rustdoc, Clippy, and Whitaker with warnings denied.
- `make test` runs `cargo nextest run` when cargo-nextest is installed and
  falls back to `cargo test` otherwise. All projects also run doctests.
- `make build` builds the debug target.
- `make release` builds the release target.
- `make coverage` writes `lcov.info` using `cargo llvm-cov` and `lld`.
- `make audit` derives the Rust workspace root with `cargo metadata` and runs
  `cargo audit` once from that root.
- `make markdownlint` checks Markdown files.
- `make nixie` validates Mermaid diagrams.

GitHub Actions Act validation lives in `.github/workflows/act-validation.yml`.
The main `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow deliberately does not run
`make test WITH_ACT=1`; the separate Act workflow runs those slower
container-backed checks in parallel.

## Tooling

Development builds use Cranelift for debug code generation. On Linux targets,
`.cargo/config.toml` configures clang to link with `mold` so debug builds link
quickly. Coverage generation uses `lld` because LLVM coverage tooling expects
LLVM-compatible linker behaviour.

Install `clang`, `lld`, `mold`, `python3`, and `cargo-audit` before running the
full generated workflow locally on Linux.

### Security audit ignores

Security audit jobs may set `CARGO_AUDIT_IGNORES` for narrowly scoped RustSec
advisories that affect unused or tooling-only dependency paths. Keep each
ignore tied to a documented runtime impact analysis, and remove it when the
affected dependency leaves the graph or the project starts using the advised
runtime path.
