"""Contract tests for the mutation-testing caller workflow.

The executable logic lives in the ``leynos/shared-actions`` reusable
workflow, which carries its own unit and integration tests; statelet's
caller is declarative configuration. These tests parse the caller with
PyYAML and pin the contract it must uphold, so drift (repointing the pin
at a branch, widening permissions, or losing the linker setup and
feature configuration) fails CI on the pull request rather than
surfacing in a scheduled or manual run.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
